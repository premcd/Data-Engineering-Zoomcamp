🚀 Week 3 of Data Engineering Zoomcamp by @DataTalksClub complete!

Just finished Module 3 - Data Warehousing with BigQuery. Learned how to:

✅ Create external tables from GCS bucket data
✅ Build materialized tables in BigQuery
✅ Partition and cluster tables for performance
✅ Understand columnar storage and query optimization
✅ Analyze NYC taxi data at scale

Homework answers:

Create an external table using the Yellow Taxi Trip Records:

Query to create the external table with the parquet files for 2024 just loaded in GCP bucket:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.external_yellow_tripdata_2024`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://module3-homework/yellow_tripdata_2024-*.parquet']
);
```

Create a (regular/materialized) table in BQ using the Yellow Taxi Trip Records (do not partition or cluster this table):

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024`
AS SELECT * FROM `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.external_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```


Question 1. Counting records

What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?

    65,623
    840,402
answer is >>>>> 20,332,093
    85,431,289

```
SELECT count(*) FROM `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.external_yellow_tripdata_2024`;
```
> 20332093


Question 2. Data read estimation

Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.

What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

    18.82 MB for the External Table and 47.60 MB for the Materialized Table
answer is>>>> 0 MB for the External Table and 155.12 MB for the Materialized Table
    2.14 GB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table
    0 MB for the External Table and 0MB for the Materialized Table

155,12 Mo for the materialized table and 0 for the external table

```
    select distinct PUlocationID from terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.external_yellow_tripdata_2024;

    select distinct PUlocationID from terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024;
```


Question 3. Understanding columnar storage

Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table.

Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

Answer is>>>> BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed.
    BigQuery duplicates data across multiple storage partitions, so selecting two columns instead of one requires scanning the table twice, doubling the estimated bytes processed.
    BigQuery automatically caches the first queried column, so adding a second column increases processing time but does not affect the estimated bytes scanned.
    When selecting multiple columns, BigQuery performs an implicit join operation between them, increasing the estimated bytes processed

```
select PUlocationID, DOLocationID from terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024;
```
--> 310,24 Mo

Question 4. Counting zero fare trips

How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

    128,210
    546,578
    20,188,016
 Answer is>>>> 8,333
```
 select COUNT (PUlocationID) from terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024
 WHERE fare_amount = 0;
 ```


Question 5. Partitioning and clustering

What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)

Answer is >>>>>Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
    Cluster on by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
    Cluster on tpep_dropoff_datetime Partition by VendorID
    Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Partition by VendorID
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.partitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024`
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS (
  SELECT * FROM `terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024`
);
```


Question 6. Partition benefits

Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive)

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?

Choose the answer which most closely matches.

    12.47 MB for non-partitioned table and 326.42 MB for the partitioned table
Answer is>>>>    310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table
    5.87 MB for non-partitioned table and 0 MB for the partitioned table
    310.31 MB for non-partitioned table and 285.64 MB for the partitioned table
```
-- Non partitionned table: 310.24Mo
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024
WHERE DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-15';

-- Partitionned table: 26.84 Mo
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.partitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024
WHERE DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-15';
```

Question 7. External table storage

Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

    Big Query
    Container Registry
Answer is>>>>GCP Bucket
    Big Table


Question 8. Clustering best practices

It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:
    True
Answer is>>>False

Question 9. Understanding table scans

No Points: Write a SELECT count(*) query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why?
>>>> 0 mO
>>>> I suspect that since Bigquery is a columnar database, it has instantly access to this information without processing anydata?

```
SELECT count(*) FROM terraform-course-485512.zoomcamp.nonpartitioned_yellow_tripdata_2024;
```
