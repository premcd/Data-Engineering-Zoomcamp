Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)

If you run dbt run --select int_trips_unioned, what models will be built?

stg_green_tripdata, stg_yellow_tripdata, and int_trips_unioned (upstream dependencies)
Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to int_trips_unioned
>answer is:int_trips_unioned only
int_trips_unioned, int_trips, and fct_trips (downstream dependencies)



Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your schema.yml:

columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false

Your model fct_trips has been running successfully for months. A new value 6 now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run dbt test --select fct_trips?

dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
`answer is: dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code`
dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
dbt will update the configuration to include the new value


Question 3. Counting Records in fct_monthly_zone_revenue

After running your dbt project, query the fct_monthly_zone_revenue model.

What is the count of records in the fct_monthly_zone_revenue model?

12,998
14,120
`answer is:12,184`
15,421


Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the fct_monthly_zone_revenue table, find the pickup zone with the highest total revenue (revenue_monthly_total_amount) for Green taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

`answer is:East Harlem North`
Morningside Heights
East Harlem South
Washington Heights South

```
SELECT pickup_zone,
revenue_month,
revenue_monthly_total_amount,
SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY pickup_zone ORDER BY revenue_month) AS total_per_zone
FROM `terraform-course-485512.dbt_mdr.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE date_trunc(revenue_month, year) = '2020-01-01 00:00:00 UTC'
AND service_type = 'Green'
ORDER BY total_per_zone DESC;
```


Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the fct_monthly_zone_revenue table, what is the total number of trips (total_monthly_trips) for Green taxis in October 2019?

500,234
350,891
`answer is:384,624`
421,509

```
WITH table as (
select pickup_zone, revenue_month, SUM(total_monthly_trips) as total from `terraform-course-485512.dbt_mdr.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
where revenue_month = '2019-10-01 00:00:00 UTC'
AND service_type = 'Green'
GROUP BY pickup_zone, revenue_month
ORDER BY total DESC)
SELECT SUM(table.total) from table
```

Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip data for 2019.

Load the FHV trip data for 2019 into your data warehouse
Create a staging model stg_fhv_tripdata with these requirements:
Filter out records where dispatching_base_num IS NULL
Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., PUlocationID → pickup_location_id)

What is the count of records in stg_fhv_tripdata?

42,084,899
`Answer is: 43,244,693`
22,998,722
44,112,187
